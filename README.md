## 1. Project Introduction

### Overview
Provide a brief overview of the project. Explain the main goal, the problem it solves, and the importance of the project. 

### Objectives
- Clearly state the objectives of the project.
- Highlight the key features and functionalities.

### Dataset
Provide a brief description of the dataset used, including the source and any relevant statistics or characteristics.

## 2. Data Preprocessing

### Data Cleaning
- Explain the steps taken to clean the data, including handling missing values, removing duplicates, and correcting errors.
- Describe any transformations or normalizations applied to the data.

### Feature Engineering
- Detail any feature engineering techniques used to create new features from the existing data.
- Include a list of the final features used in the model.

### Data Splitting
- Describe how the data was split into training, validation, and test sets.
- Include the proportions or specific methods used for splitting.

### Example Code
```python
# Example of data preprocessing steps
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

# Load data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Data cleaning
data.dropna(inplace=True)
data.drop_duplicates(inplace=True)

# Feature engineering
data['new_feature'] = data['existing_feature'] ** 2

# Data splitting
train_data, test_data = train_test_split(data, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
